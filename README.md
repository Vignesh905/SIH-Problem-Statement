## **Problem Title**  
**SIH 1789: AI-Powered Resume Screening and Automated Interview System**  

---

## **Problem Description**  
### **Background:**  
Recruitment in large organizations often involves screening thousands of resumes and conducting multiple rounds of interviews, making the process time-consuming and prone to bias. Traditional hiring methods lack efficiency in filtering candidates based on precise job requirements.  

### **Description:**  
An AI-powered resume screening and automated interview system can streamline the hiring process by intelligently analyzing resumes, matching candidates to job roles, and conducting automated initial interviews. The system should filter resumes based on key criteria such as skills, experience, and education, and then conduct AI-driven preliminary interviews with candidates before scheduling human interactions.  

### **Expected Solution:**  
The proposed system will:  
- Use AI-driven NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyze and rank resumes based on job descriptions.  
- Conduct an AI-powered chatbot/video interview that evaluates candidates’ communication skills, technical knowledge, and cultural fit.  
- Provide recruiters with auto-generated candidate evaluation reports.  
- Offer bias-free and standardized screening for fair recruitment.  
- Include analytics and insights for HR teams to optimize hiring strategies.
